# Class-Project
  - The repository showcases the attempt to predict what customers would buy in the future.
## Overview
  - The task as stated in the Kaggle challenge is to use 15 different features, looking into when they were active within the first 6 months. The approach is to use classification and comparing histograms to see how a customer activation from the first 6 months. In summary, class I which stands for inactivation has more data showcased then any other data.
## Summary of Workdone
### Data
  - CSV file
  - Size: 254871 x 24
  #### Preprocessing
    - I had to look to see if there were any missing values, which there were. There were a total of 5 categories that had missing values and then I got rid of those missing values.
## How to Reproduce
  - Remove the missing values to get a better-looking dataset.
  - It's best to use Google Collab due to it being easier to load the dataset, however, if the dataset is too big the package won't download. Then at that it would be best to use Jupyter Notebook.
### Software Setup
- There really is no package but a notebook that you can download called Class-Project.ipynb
### Data
  - You can download the data using this link https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santander-product-recommendation/data
